            This Cookie Policy explains how GiveHope uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you
            visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to

          <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GiveHope) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
            interactive content, and analytics).
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
          <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>

          <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are
            usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting
            your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you
            about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.
          </p>

          <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of
            our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around
            the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
          </p>

          <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by
            us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies,
            then some or all of these services may not function properly.
          </p>

          <h3>Targeting Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies
            to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store
            directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.
          </p>

          <h2>How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies,
            you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
            restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser
            to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
          </p>

          <h2>How Often Will We Update This Cookie Policy?</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies
            we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy
            regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
